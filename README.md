clicking on colours moves dye into appropriate slot.
clicking on banner pattern automatically completes the pattern, brings the output back into the input slot
clicking on "blank" pattern brings in a blank banner of that colour.



TODO: 
- create config options for auto output-into-input or not
- redraw new GUI background
- render the banner display thingie

Longer term TODO:
- maybe include some way to save complete banners with multiple patterns, and create them in one go
- maybe a way to use keyboard to type out banners? would be cool



(this mod was made with [ClongCraft](https://linktr.ee/ClongCraft) in mind - we apparently use banners there)




with inspiration from https://github.com/NotchArrow/Interlace
