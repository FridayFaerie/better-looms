- clicking on colours moves dye into appropriate slot.
- clicking on banner pattern automatically completes the pattern, brings the output back into the input slot
- clicking on "blank" pattern brings in a blank banner of that colour.
- also supports keyboard input - using https://banner-writer.web.app/keylayout.png as the default layout
- able to create banners with more than 6 patterns (disabled by default)


(this mod was made with [ClongCraft](https://linktr.ee/ClongCraft) in mind - we apparently use banners there)
