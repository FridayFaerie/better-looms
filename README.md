- clicking on colours moves dye into appropriate slot.
- clicking on banner pattern automatically completes the pattern, brings the output back into the input slot
- clicking on "blank" pattern brings in a blank banner of that colour.




TODO: 
- add finishing touches to GUI



(this mod was made with [ClongCraft](https://linktr.ee/ClongCraft) in mind - we apparently use banners there)
